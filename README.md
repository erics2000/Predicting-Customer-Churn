# Machine Learning and Data Analysis Project

This project is focused on data analysis and machine learning model development using Python. The project includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and the handling of imbalanced datasets.

## Project Structure

- **Package Installation and Setup**: The project starts by installing necessary packages such as `sqlalchemy`, `pandasql`, and others. It ensures the correct environment is set up for data manipulation and model training.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook includes preprocessing steps to handle categorical data, feature scaling, and train-test splits using `scikit-learn`.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: Used as a baseline model for classification.
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: Implemented for further model improvement.
  - **Deep Learning with PyTorch**: Neural network models are built using `torch` for complex datasets.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: The models are evaluated using multiple performance metrics, including:
  - Accuracy
  - F1-Score
  - Precision and Recall
  - ROC-AUC Score

- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: The project uses techniques such as:
  - **Random Under Sampling**: To balance the classes by reducing the majority class.
  - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: To generate synthetic samples for the minority class.

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run this project:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn torch sqlalchemy pandasql imblearn
